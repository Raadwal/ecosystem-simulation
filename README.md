# Short descritpion
An ecosystem simulation created using C++ and Unreal Engine.

# Long description
The goal of the project was to create an application using the capabilities of the Unreal Engine game engine, version 5.1, with the primary objective of simulating a simple ecosystem. The world, where animals move and plants grow, is procedurally generated using Perlin noise. The terrain is divided into several biomes, each with unique properties that either facilitate or hinder survival within them. During the simulation, plants and animals undergo random mutations, which alter their basic statistics.
## 1. Terrain generation
The terrain generator has several option. User can also set predefined seed.

After clicking **Generate World**, the 3D version of the terrain is generated.

Each biome is generated by a different generator, which allows for faster mesh generation and the implementation of biome-specific statuses.

## Camera and HUD
In the project, a top-down camera was used. The user can zoom and move the camera using keys and arrows. After clicking on an animal or plant, its statistics are displayed.

## Plants and animals
There are 3 species of plants and 4 species of animals that can interact with each other during the simulation. Each biome gives different buffs and debuffs to both animals and plants.

## Simulation
During the simulation, herbivores have to find plants to eat, water to drink, and mates to reproduce. Similarly, carnivores need to find food in the form of other animals. During the simulation, animals receive buffs and debuffs depending on the biome they are currently in. For example, in the desert biome, animals need more water, and plants won't grow unless they have a mutation for heat resistance. With each animal or plant reproduction, there is a chance for the species to mutate and gain new positive or negative traits.
